content_title: FOC Software Installation
---

There are various ways to install and use the FOC software:

* [Install FOC Prebuilt Binaries](00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md)
* [Build FOC from Source](01_build-from-source/index.md)

[[info]]
| If you are new to FOC, it is recommended that you install the [FOC Prebuilt Binaries](00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md), then proceed to the [Getting Started](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-home/docs/) section of the [FOC Developer Portal](https://developers.eos.io/). If you are an advanced developer, a block producer, or no binaries are available for your platform, you may need to [Build FOC from source](01_build-from-source/index.md) instead.

## Supported Operating Systems

FOC currently supports the following operating systems:

1. Amazon Linux 2
2. CentOS 7
3. Ubuntu 16.04
4. Ubuntu 18.04
5. MacOS 10.14 (Mojave)

[[info | Note]]
| It may be possible to install FOC on other Unix-based operating systems. This is not officially supported, though.
